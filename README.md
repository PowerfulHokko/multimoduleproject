# multimoduleproject

Q: "Wow, this is a pretty neat project you're making! Any reason for it? Any plans with it?"
A: "Thanks, I got bored. Maybe if it becomes more pro I'll make it an opensource thing, but for now as you can see I don't have any unit tests (I perfer end-to-end test) and I still have some things to configure and adjust."
